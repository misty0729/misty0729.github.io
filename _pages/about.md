Hi! I am a third year PhD student in Computer Science and Technology at [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), where I obtained a bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science and Technology in 2019. I conduct research under the supervision of Professor [Peng Cui](http://cuip.thumedialab.com/) and Professor [Bo Li](http://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/libo).

My research interests include fair machine learning, out-of-distribution generalization, and causal inference.
